# galvanize_capstone_1
#test README

#give summary of original data sets
*use table from proposal
#what does each bring?
*compare the different drought indices
#what does the final dataset look like?
*make new summary table 

#goals
*how do drought trends change from 2000 - 2016
*indices should capture combination of drought severity and length

#how are the drought indices different (if at all)?
#how has water well depth changed since 2000 (if at all)
#is there any correlation between drought and water well levels

#plots to highlight

#make a chart of the palues for the correlation matrix - shading
#put in chart for three drought indices over time
#put in chart for water well change over time (remember to multiple * -1 to better illustrate decreasing water levels)







#no correlation between well water levels and drought
#would be intersting to extend the study to include other factors (population growth/decline, geology factors such as recharge time, etc. )

#after finding no correlation between these - wanted to focus on how drought and water level depths are trending over the state indiviually with time
